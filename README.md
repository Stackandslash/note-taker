### Details
This is a simple note-taking app, with the front-facing interface already pre-complated. My work here is on the API calls involved.

* The user can write and add as many notes as they like. Each one is assigned a unique ID, allowing for selective removal.

* The user can create a new note and save by using the appropriate icon. At the moment, editing does not appear to be directly supported.


### Issues
The program is largely a simple one, so outside display issues and call/delete problems, opportunities for failure are limited.

* Text content is not restricted. This could be troublesome for integrity, so exercise caution when in use.
